# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

For this assignment, I had to create an application that displays weather data, based on the user's search. The goal is to have the user inut a particular city, and have that city's current wether information display, as well as the five-day forecast for that city. The user has the option to search multiple cities, with a list appearing of cities already viewed.

## Areas to Improve

I was successful in console logging the information needed BEFORE I created my functions, so I know that at one point, I was getting somewhere. after I added the code that was necessary to retrieve the desired data, the code stopped being responsive (in the inspector, as well as the console itself). Still need improvement working with localStorage, but I am more curious as to why I could not see any results. I would have been more happy seeing mulitple errors pop up. At least I would have an idea of where to start de-bugging.

UPDATE: Successful in retreiving current city data, 5-day forecast, and clearing search history. For the future, I want to specify the exact state for more specific results.
